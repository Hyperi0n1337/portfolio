### Technical Projects üõ†Ô∏è
**Brain-Computer Interface: Controlling the IoT**  
[Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2rnAEK-Ir0) , [Research Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZXyd4hyd0DHZHuqq-xwnf3NUk_3Tcm13hOrmA9TCF8/edit)  
<p align="justify">
I collaborated on developing a brain-computer interface that allowed users to control IoT devices using only their eye movements. We used an Emotiv EEG headset to measure brain activity in the visual cortex as users focused on flashing lights at different frequencies on a web page. By performing a Fourier transform on the EEG signal data in Python, we could determine which light the user was looking at.  
</p><p align="justify">
&emsp;We designed a web page with four flashing lights that acted as control buttons, representing different rooms and devices. By focusing on a light, users could navigate the web page and toggle devices on and off. We implemented criteria in our Python algorithm to reliably detect which light the user was focusing on, then sent signals to control the IoT devices accordingly using a Raspberry Pi as the server.  
</p><p align="justify">
&emsp;Through this project, I gained valuable experience in EEG signal processing, developing brain-computer interfaces, human-computer interaction, IoT device control, and collaborative technical projects. While further refinements would be needed for practical use, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of controlling devices with only eye movements using low-cost consumer EEG headsets. Overall, this project expanded my skills in biomedical systems, signal processing, and implementing accessible technologies for people with disabilities.  </p>
