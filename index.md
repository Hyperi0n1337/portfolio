## About Me üë®üèª‚Äçüíº

I'm Markos Terzidis, a highly analytical professional with a diverse background spanning engineering, finance, and entrepreneurship. Born in Athens, Greece, I'm a dual citizen of Greece and the United States, and I've leveraged my multilingual skills in English, Russian, and Greek to build an international career.

&emsp;My journey began with a full-ride merit scholarship at Rowan University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering. During my academic years, I honed my skills in software tools like MATLAB, Solidworks, and Excel, that cultivated my problem-solving abilities and analytical mindset.

&emsp;After completing my degree, I gained valuable engineering experience through internships in mechanical design and petroleum engineering. This practical knowledge allowed me to contribute significantly to the family business, gaining a comprehensive understanding of finance and international business relationships.

&emsp;My passion for finance led me to actively manage portfolios, not only for myself but also for high-net-worth clients. I specialize in financial analysis, modeling, risk management, and algorithmic trading, and I've achieved commendable returns through active crypto trading and yield farming strategies.

&emsp;With a global perspective from living and working in five countries across three continents, I possess cross-cultural fluency and adaptability.

&emsp;Moving forward, I hope to apply my diverse skillset and interdisciplinary experience to new challenges that leverage my analytical capabilities. With expertise spanning engineering, finance, entrepreneurship, and an academic focus on applied mathematics, I'm driven to pursue multifaceted opportunities that allow me to devise inventive solutions and create outsized value.

### Technical Projects üõ†Ô∏è
**Brain-Computer Interface: Controlling the IoT**  

I collaborated on developing a brain-computer interface that allowed users to control IoT devices using only their eye movements. We used an Emotiv EEG headset to measure brain activity in the visual cortex as users focused on flashing lights at different frequencies on a web page. By performing a Fourier transform on the EEG signal data in Python, we could determine which light the user was looking at.  

&emsp;We designed a web page with four flashing lights that acted as control buttons, representing different rooms and devices. By focusing on a light, users could navigate the web page and toggle devices on and off. We implemented criteria in our Python algorithm to reliably detect which light the user was focusing on, then sent signals to control the IoT devices accordingly using a Raspberry Pi as the server.  

&emsp;Through this project, I gained valuable experience in EEG signal processing, developing brain-computer interfaces, human-computer interaction, IoT device control, and collaborative technical projects. While further refinements would be needed for practical use, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of controlling devices with only eye movements using low-cost consumer EEG headsets. Overall, this project expanded my skills in biomedical systems, signal processing, and implementing accessible technologies for people with disabilities.  
&emsp;
