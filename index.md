##### Early Life & High School

I grew up in Greece as a dual citizen of Greece and the United States. My mother is American, and we frequently visited relatives in the States and traveled internationally. Growing up, I spoke Russian, English, and Greek. This multilingual ability was due to my grandmother, who spoke Russian to me; Greek from the Black Sea.

During my education in Greece, I attended a private high school that offered a range of cultural experiences not found in public schools. These experiences included traditional Greek dances and performances of ancient Greek plays, and I studied French as a third language. Alongside my studies, I pursued extracurricular activities such as playing tennis and piano.

In my high school years, I furthered my education by attending the International Baccalaureate program. This advanced program, taught in English, catered to students aspiring to study abroad. I studied subjects like Chemistry, Economics, and Physics at a high level. Even in high school, I acquired certification in Microsoft Excel, and we used visual basic in some programming classes.

During this time, my professor in the Theory Of Knowledge class noted my sharp intellect. Encouraged by this, I took the SAT and achieved a commendable score. While I received scholarship offers from various universities, I chose to attend Rowan University, attracted by a full scholarship and the institution's strong reputation in Chemical Engineering.

#### Education
**Rowan University**
Bachelor of Science - BS, Chemical Engineering 
2013 - 2018
Activities and societies: American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), Undergraduate Research
Merit-based scholarship that fully covered tuition
Developed team and design skills while working with students from four different engineering disciplines.
Utilized oral and written communication skills to produce project documentation and presentations. Researched related patents, economic and technical feasibility, safety and ethical issues.
**International Baccalaureate**
2011 - 2013
Chemistry, Physics. Economics HL
##### Rowan University Projects

**Cocoa Processing Plant: Design and Recommendations** 
Collaborated with a team of undergraduate chemical engineering students to model a plant that produces cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Researched all major chemicals involved in the process, patents, and FDA regulations. Developed a block flow diagram, process flow diagram, piping and instrumentation diagram, project execution plan, equipment list, sizing and cost of equipment, material and energy balances, failure mode effect analysis (FMEA), and life cycle analysis. Calculated annual project revenues based on price analysis, calculated an estimate of total installed cost, and calculated a projected fixed and variable operating cost. Used heat integration to find ways to lower variable operating costs while keep the projected fixed cost low. Analyzed depreciation value, salvaged value, tax rate, etc. to determined when profit was attained.
**Brain-Computer Interface: Controlling the IoT**
As part of a university project, I collaborated on developing a brain-computer interface that allowed users to control IoT devices using only their eye movements. We used an Emotiv EEG headset to measure brain activity in the visual cortex as users focused on flashing lights at different frequencies on a web page. By performing a Fourier transform on the EEG signal data in Python, we could determine which light the user was looking at. 
We designed a web page with four flashing lights that acted as control buttons, representing different rooms and devices. By focusing on a light, users could navigate the web page and toggle devices on and off. We implemented criteria in our Python algorithm to reliably detect which light the user was focusing on, then sent signals to control the IoT devices accordingly using a Raspberry Pi as the server.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in EEG signal processing, developing brain-computer interfaces, human-computer interaction, IoT device control, and collaborative technical projects. While further refinements would be needed for practical use, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility of controlling devices with only eye movements using low-cost consumer EEG headsets. Overall, this project expanded my skills in biomedical systems, signal processing, and implementing accessible technologies for people with disabilities.
**Biodiesel Production**
Led experimental chemistry project to create biodiesel fuel from waste vegetable oil (WVO). Utilized lab equipment to convert WVO into biodiesel through transesterification reaction with methanol and sodium hydroxide. Achieved 92.27% biodiesel yield. Tested density, pH, and viscosity of biodiesel compared to source oils. Recorded specific gravity of 913 kg/m3 for olive oil versus 880 kg/m3 for washed biodiesel. Ran biodiesel fuel in generator, producing 2199 Watts over 78 seconds from 30 mL of biodiesel. Gained hands-on experience with chemical processes, data logging, solution testing, fuel analysis, and alternative energy sources. Demonstrated biodiesel feasibility through quantitative experimentation.
**Wind Turbine Parametrization**

#### Career Progression

Through a full merit scholarship, I earned my ChemEng degree after rounding out my education with two internships: one utilizing SolidWorks for undergarment molds at Lion Design, and another in pipeline corrosion research and drilling operations with LUKOIL.

After spending five years in the US, I returned to Greece to join my family's SME manufacturing women's lingerie, swimwear, and clothing accessories. During my two years at the company, I honed communication skills engaging international clients and managed finances, including cash flow, investment pricing, financial analysis, and profitability tracking. This experience allowed me to complement my engineering background by developing skills in business and finance. Given the challenges of European manufacturing like high costs and taxes, I pivoted to finance to leverage my analytical skills and economics knowledge.

Since then, I have actively managed my personal portfolio and investments for high-net-worth clients, leveraging my multilingual skills to build an international client base. I provided personalized guidance aligned to distinct goals and risk profiles across crypto, forex, equities, and real estate. My active crypto trading and yield farming strategies generated good returns, and I exercised prudent risk management. I collaborated with programmers to design a sophisticated backtesting framework. With in-depth experience across financial analysis, modeling, trading, risk management, and programming, I am pursuing quant roles where I can utilize my skillset and passion for markets.
